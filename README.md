# RescueNet Project

## About the Project

This project was created to simulate the restoration of the network infrastructure in Turkey following the February 6th earthquake using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project aims to quickly re-establish network connectivity in disaster-affected areas to support emergency response and rescue efforts.

## Abstract

The proposed solution involves the utilization of specially equipped trucks named "RescueNet" to quickly restore network connectivity in earthquake-affected areas. These trucks are designed to rapidly reach disaster zones and become operational immediately. Consequently, individuals in the affected area can regain access to vital networks shortly after the earthquake, facilitating effective communication for emergency response and rescue efforts.

Essentially, the operation of these trucks is as follows: Upon arrival at the earthquake zone where the network infrastructure has collapsed, the trucks release drones equipped with Access Points (APs). These APs extend the coverage of the local network, making it easier for users to connect to the network. The APs are connected to an Access Point Controller (APC) inside the truck, which is in turn connected to a router. This router establishes a fast and reliable network connection to the Türksat satellite via SD-WAN, ensuring seamless communication. The satellite connection also enables communication with DNS and web servers in the safe zone area, facilitating smoother navigation for users on the network.

The entire setup, including the deployment of drones and APs, will be simulated and tested using Cisco Packet Tracer to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the solution. This simulation will help identify potential issues and ensure that the system operates efficiently in real-world disaster scenarios.
